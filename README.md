# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
The Pizza Sales Analysis project is a data exploration case study designed to extract actionable insights from a fictional pizza shopâ€™s order data. The dataset includes order-level data with attributes such as order date, order time, pizza category, size, quantity, and total price. Using Microsoft Excel, key dashboards and visualizations were created to provide at-a-glance insights. Additionally, SQL was used to query the database and generate KPIs, segmented trends, and performance metrics that would help stakeholders make informed business decisions.
